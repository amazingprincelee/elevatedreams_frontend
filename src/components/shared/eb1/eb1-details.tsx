          A Pathway to U.S. Permanent Residency for High-Achieving Individuals
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The EB-1 visa is an employment-based first-preference immigrant visa
          designed for individuals with exceptional abilities, outstanding
          academic achievements, or executive-level managerial experience.
          Unlike other visa categories, the EB-1 has a streamlined process that
          does not require labor certification, making it one of the most
          sought-after immigration pathways.

              Why the EB-1 Visa Is Highly Competitive
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
              The EB-1 visa category is in high demand due to its benefits,
              including faster processing times and exemption from labor
              certification. In Fiscal Year 2024, the employment-based visa
              quota was set at 160,791, covering all EB categories. Due to
              increasing demand, the EB-1 visa reached its annual limit before
              the end of the fiscal year, highlighting the importance of early
              application.
